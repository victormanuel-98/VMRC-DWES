There was once a kingdom of 10 billion people.    |
Demons led by seven trumpeters descended from     |
the sky and destroyed the civilization of         |
humankind, the sea withered and the land was      |
decayed.                                          |
                                                  |
9,999,856,000 people were slaughtered. The mass   |
center of the star was shifted and the sun no     |
longer rose or set. There were those who sided    |
with the oppressed people. Angels appeared from   |
the depths of the severed land and guided the     |
survivors to the twilight realm, a land where     |
humans could survive.                             |
                                                  |
The angels built a group of mechanical fortresses |
called “The Citadel” to protect the remaining     |
humankind, as the last sphere of human            |
existence."                                       |
